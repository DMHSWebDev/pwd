            <h2>About.</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m [Your Name], an aspiring web developer and designer with a deep passion for coding and
                creativity. Currently,
                I’m a student honing my skills in both web development and design, and I’m excited to build a career
                that blends my love
                for technology with my flair for visual storytelling.
            </p>

            <p>I find immense joy in creating clean, user-friendly websites that not only function seamlessly but also
                look visually
                striking. Whether it's coding a responsive layout, designing an intuitive UI, or experimenting with the
                latest design
                trends, I’m always eager to learn and improve. My curiosity drives me to explore new tools, frameworks,
                and design
                techniques, and I thrive on challenges that push me to grow as both a developer and a designer.</p>
            <p>With a keen eye for detail and a strong desire to continuously improve, I aspire to contribute to
                projects that leave a
                lasting impact, all while building a successful career in web development and design. My goal is to
                combine my technical
                skills with my creativity to help businesses and individuals create beautiful and functional online
                experiences.</p>
